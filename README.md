## Intro To Computing
Project for CSC 103 - Intro To Computing with Professor William Skeith at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
In this project, you’ll re-implement some standard unix utilities. In particular, you’ll make clones (perhaps with some missing or different functionality) of wc,sort,uniq,shuf and tr.

- What you’ll learn from doing this:
- More about basic C++ data structures.
- Functions and arguments.
- A bit more about the unix shell.
## Additional Information
- This works through inputs and does not pass all the tests since the tests reads from a file.
